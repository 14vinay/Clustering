Clustering customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using unsupervised machine learning can help the mallâ€™s management team tailor customer service, optimize product offering according to the customer grouping.


## Problem Statement
A shopping mall aims to enahance its marketing strategies and personalize customer experiences by understanding its diverse customer base.
## Approach
The goal is to apply a machine learning based clustering algorithm that can segment customers into distinct groups based on demographic data (such as age, gender, income) and behavioral patterns (spending score).
1. Understanding the different types of features present in data.
2. Cleaning the data set.
3. Data analysis.
4. Model Building.
